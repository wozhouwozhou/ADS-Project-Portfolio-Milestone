## Portfolio Requirement
Students will complete a Portfolio to provide an assessment of learning for their program. Students will choose assignments and projects worked on in courses during the course of study which reflect abilities specified in the program learning outcomes for inclusion in their personal portfolio. A panel of faculty who teach the courses included in the program will review the portfolios of graduates during the students’ final term. The panel will approve the portfolio for each student as a transcript milestone required for the degree.
